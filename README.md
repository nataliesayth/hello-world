# hello-world
This repository is for introducing myself!

I am a Data Analyst who's worked in the FBI, Planned Parenthood, and TV writers' rooms. My #1 ethos is efficiency in communication, which you should see in all my produced content, from Python-coded notebooks to Tableau visualizations and analytic prose. I work as a curious self-starter and supportive collaborator with a steady commitment to source integrity. Let's have a conversation! I'm up to the challenge of contextualization information in a way you hadn't considered.
